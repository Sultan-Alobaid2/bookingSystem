# bookingSystem

Apache Airlines is introducing a seat reservation system for its Burak757 passenger aircraft designed to streamline the booking procedure for customers. The system enables users to view accessible seats, book seats, cancel reservations, and even view existing seating plans.
Written in Python, the system employs a text-file based system for handling seat allocations and passengers' information, with an emphasis on simplicity and efficiency.
